# Semi_Automatic_2-axis_CNC_table


Project Objective :  
   
    the project objective is to design ,manufacture and control Semi Automatic_2-axis CNC table.
    
Project Duration :
    
    August 2022 ; during the summer holiday after establishing my LAB to be used with my press drill.
    
Project Description :   
    First the Semi Automatic_2-axis CNC table is designed and modeled on Solidworks and then the designed parts is manufactured using LASER cutting machine and conventional Lathe, then assembled in my LAB with the assembly steps and all the rails are mounted and caliprated with dial indicator.
    The system is designed to be used with two modes of operation ; manual withe the rollers and automatic with arduino based control . last but not least the software is designed to take coordinates from the user and convert them to stepper signals going to the stepper drivers.
    the system is assembled and did a trial with manual mode however I didn't complete the automatic setup due to the educational semester interruption.
